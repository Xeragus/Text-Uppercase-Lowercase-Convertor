Python script that converts uppercase text to lowercase text and vice versa. The user selects the conversion type. The first command line argument is the conversion type, if 0 then the scripts converts from lowercase to uppercase, if 1 then the scripts does the opposite. The second command line argument is the name of the file that you want to convert, and the third command line argument is the name of the result file.
